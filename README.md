For your Academy I want you to create a small application that uses https://punkapi.com/ API RESTful services.
You need to work as a team to accomplish the final goal.

#Application

You need to build a small application that accomplishes the following:
  - List of beers
  - Application should have a search bar to filter the list;
  - Application should have a cart to buy any drink (Just the page and create a fake store)
  - Application should have a screen with drinkâ€™s details;
  - Login with an external provider (Google or Facebook)


#Procedure
 - Get your API Key as explained within the documentation https://punkapi.com/
 - Use Xcode (Swift) and use Github;
 - You can use third-party libraries with their preference to handle dependencies;
 - Take the opportunity to showcase your coding style and use the MVVM / VIPER design pattern.

#Plus
- Pagination
- Functional programming
- Adapt UI to mobile orientation changes and iPad
- Add more items as you wish
- Application should permit login with facebook and google.
